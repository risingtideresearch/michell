//! Michell's thin-ship wave resistance integral.
//!
//! With ν = g/U², half-beam f(x, z), z downward from the waterline:
//!
//! ```text
//! R_w = (4 ρ g²)/(π U²) ∫_1^∞ (I² + J²) λ²/√(λ² − 1) dλ
//! I(λ) + i J(λ) = ∬ (∂f/∂x) exp(−ν λ² z) exp(i ν λ x) dx dz
//! ```
//!
//! (Tuck 1989; Dambrine, Pierre & Rousseaux 2016.) Substituting λ = sec θ
//! turns the outer integral into `∫_0^{π/2} (I² + J²) sec³θ dθ`, removing the
//! integrable singularity at λ = 1.
//!
//! This module holds what every hull representation shares: the options and
//! results, the transom closure, and the smooth outer θ-integral, integrated
//! with Gauss–Legendre panels sized to the local oscillation rate and then
//! refined until the requested tolerance is met. The amplitudes come from
//! [`crate::sectional`].
//!
//! In tests it also carries the **exact B-spline kernel** ([`InnerIntegral`]):
//! for a half-breadth spline `f(x, z)` I and J are evaluated exactly per knot
//! span via the closed-form moments in [`hullgeom::moments`]. It is the oracle
//! the sectional kernel is validated against.

/// transom over a hollow length `L_v`, with the half-beam decaying
/// `f_v(x, z) = f_T(z)·φ(s)`, `s = (x_T − x)/L_v`. The shape is the smoothstep
/// `φ(s) = (1 − s)²(1 + 2s)`, flat at both ends, so the appendage introduces no
/// new discontinuity of its own: `f` is continuous at the transom and closes
/// tangentially. The bare step is the `L_v → 0` limit and is recovered exactly.
