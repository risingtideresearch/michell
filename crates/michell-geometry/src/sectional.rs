//! **Sectional** hulls: a hull described by its stations, each a section
//! curve with its own depth quadrature, the whole interpolated along the
//! length by a B-spline.
//!
//! Every hull transform the hydrodynamic crates need is of the form
//! `∬ f(x, z) e^{−κz} e^{ik_x x} dx dz` (or its `∂f/∂x` and
//! `(x − x_c) ∂f/∂x` variants). Write it as
//!
//! ```text
//! ∫ Z(x; κ) e^{ik_x x} dx,      Z(x; κ) = ∫ f(x, z) e^{−κz} dz,
//! ```
//!
//! and do the depth integral **per station**, along the station's own section
//! curve. The keel is then just the end of that curve: the crease a lofted
//! `f(x, z)` has along a rockered keel line, and the square-root closure of a
//! round bilge onto it, are both inside a 1-D integral that absorbs them, and
//! `Z(x; κ)` is smooth in `x` wherever the hull's sections vary smoothly.
//!
//! Everything that depends on `κ` is one pass over the stations' depth nodes
//! (`Σ_j w_j e^{−κ z_j}` per station) followed by one banded solve for the
//! B-spline interpolant of `Z(·; κ)` along `x` ([`SectionalHull::contract`]);
//! each `k_x` at that `κ` then costs one closed-form oscillatory-moment call
//! per x-span. The interpolant is exposed span by span in each span's local
//! power basis ([`SectionalHull::spans`], [`SectionalContracted::g_f`]), so
//! a hydrodynamic crate can build its own transforms on it; the plain
//! Fourier transforms are here ([`SectionalHull::x_transform`]).
//!
//! Hulls are cut from CAD through [`crate::source::HullSource`]; the
//! hydrostatics (volume, centre of buoyancy, waterplane, wetted surface) are
//! exact integrals of the same interpolants.
