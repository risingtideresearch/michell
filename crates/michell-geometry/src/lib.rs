//! # michell-geometry
//!
//! Hull **geometry** for the hydrodynamic crates of this workspace: hulls cut
//! from CAD into **sections**, their hydrostatics, and the platform's
//! hydrostatic equilibrium. It knows nothing of any flow theory — the
//! thin-ship wave kernel (`michell`) and strip-theory seakeeping
//! (`michell-seakeeping`) are both built on it.
//!
//! ## Where hulls come from
//!
//! A [`SectionalHull`] is cut from source geometry kept in its own frame, so
//! it can be re-posed and re-cut as often as a sweep or an equilibrium solve
//! needs ([`source::HullSource`]):
//!
//! - **IGES** B-spline surfaces ([`iges::source_fleet`], or surfaces already
//!   in hand through [`iges::source_fleet_from_surfaces`] — e.g. the exact
//!   Wigley test hull, [`iges::wigley_surfaces`]),
//! - **STL** triangle meshes ([`stl::mesh_fleet`]).
//!
//! Frames: CAD sources are `x` along the hull, `y` transverse, `z` **up**;
//! a cut hull's sections measure `z` downward from the effective waterline.
//! All quantities are SI. Hulls are port/starboard symmetric about their
//! centreplanes; the bow is the high-`x` end.
//!
//! ## What a sectional hull offers
//!
//! - hydrostatics: displaced volume, centre of buoyancy, waterplane area and
//!   its first and second moments, wetted surface, transom;
//! - the per-station section curves ([`SectionalHull::curves`]);
//! - the depth-decayed section integrals `Z(x; κ) = ∫ f(x, z) e^{−κz} dz`
//!   interpolated along `x` in closed form per span
//!   ([`SectionalHull::contract`]), and their Fourier transforms along `x`
//!   ([`SectionalHull::x_transform`]) — the building block of every
//!   wavenumber-domain hull integral.
//!
//! ## Equilibrium
//!
//! [`float`] floats a fleet of hulls to carry a load, re-cutting each hull at
//! every trial pose; a hydrodynamic crate can fold a speed-dependent load
//! into the same solve through [`float::DynamicModel`].
