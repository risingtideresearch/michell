//! Hydrostatic equilibrium: solve the platform's sinkage and pitch so the
//! fleet displaces a given weight with its centre of buoyancy under a given
//! centre of gravity.
//!
//! Newton iteration on (sinkage s, pitch τ) with residuals
//! `(∇ − W/ρ, M_x − lcg·∇)`; the Jacobian is analytic from waterplane
//! properties (area, first and second longitudinal moments — the classical
//! tons-per-cm / moment-to-trim relations). Iterations run on a coarsened
//! sampling of the hulls, then the solution is polished on the requested
//! resolution. A hull lifting fully out of the water during iteration is
//! handled (its contribution drops to zero), and being dry at equilibrium is
//! reported, not an error.
//!
//! The balance is *hydrostatic* by default. At speed the hull also feels a
//! hydrodynamic vertical force and pitch moment (thin-ship dynamic sinkage
//! and trim); [`solve_equilibrium_dynamic_with`] folds a caller-supplied
//! [`DynamicLoad`] into the same Newton core as a forcing term.
