//! `boatmath` — Unix-style tools for doing physics on boats. Records are
//! JSON, one per line; each command reads a stream, writes it through, and
//! adds what it made, so the stream at the end of a pipeline holds the
//! whole computation:
//!
//! ```sh
//! boatmath hull guillemot.igs --waterline 0.12 \
//!   | boatmath case --mass 150,200 \
//!   | boatmath study --froude 0.2:0.6:0.05 \
//!   | boatmath run -j 8 \
//!   | boatmath table study.case.params.mass study.params.froude forces.rt
//! ```
